# Movement_IG_Injection
This repo was created to develop the code necessary to perform the analysis of mice CM velocity during sessions of intragastric injection of different reinforcers.

...Place here info on the rational behind the approach and the need for this analysis

1. DLC analysis of body part location in a session
Describe all the parameters used for training a DLC network (videos used, iterations, frames selected, conditions used, network, ...)

2. Find the moment of session onset
